## Content:

#### I – Data cleaning

###### First analysis of the dataframe
###### Application idea
Application based on the calculation of the sugar level of foods. I took all the sugars and their derivatives as well as the different information that could be useful for the consumer and the nutriscore. 
###### Treatment of outliers
Drop all the values : above 100 and below 0 for sugar, this derivatives and proteins, above 3000 and below 0 for energy and above -15 and below 40 for nutriscore. 
###### Treatment of missing values



#### II – Exploratory analysis
